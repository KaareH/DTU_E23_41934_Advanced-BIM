Importance of keeping structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

During assingment 2, and a great deal of assingment 3, I mostly wrote the code in huge Jupyter notebooks
filled with various experiements and garbage code. This made it very difficult to keep track of what I had
to do, and which code was be used. To some extend, I would later copy some code into `.py` files if I deemed
it to be kept. However, this was not a good way to work, and I would often end lost in a big pile of code.

Later during assingment 3, I started to use a more structured approach, and attempted to write most of the code
in the `PyConBIM` package modules from the beginning. This made it much easier to keep track of what I had
done, and what I had to do. It also made it easier to reuse code, and to keep the code clean and readable.

Another issue, was the relatively long/processing time of the large LLYN IFC model, which hindered my workflow.
This was one of the reasons, I initially worked in Jupyter notebooks, to keep the processed model in memory
during development. Again, this made it difficult to keep track of variables, and the order of which code had
been executed. The large model would also be overwhelming to visually inspect, and difficult to get a good overview.

As I moved away from the Jupyter notebooked oriented workflow, I made a small dummy IFC-model, which had just the
right amount of complexity to test the code, whilst still being small. This vastly improved my workflow.
Though not many, I also made a few automated unit tests, which would help notify, if I broke something.
